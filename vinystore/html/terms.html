    In the event that the checks do not have a positive outcome, VinyStore takes all necessary steps to inform you, via e-mail, that a decrease in value of the returned Products has been detected, deriving from your failure to comply with the conditions indicated in this section Return Policy (Right to Withdraw) and the amount corresponding to such decrease in value.
    In the event that your return does not comply with the terms and conditions set out in this section, you will not be entitled to any refund of sums already paid to VinyStore; nevertheless, you shall be entitled, at your own expense, to receive the Products in the conditions in which they were sent back to VinyStore.
