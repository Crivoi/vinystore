        The story is very simple i guess…and it’s coming from my heart. Years ago i dedicated myself to music. Listen, listen, listen played records, listen again.
        <br>My space became a place with a lot of records and music and i was thinking “Why not having a place for friends where they could listen and enjoy some good records like we did some time ago in my old room?” So, the story began. My friends supported and encouraged me, everybody was happy and we still are
        <br>VinyStore lives now more than ever, it’s growing and i hope to be only the start of a musical journey.
